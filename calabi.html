        You’re probably wondering what this tangled mess of tubes and folds is. Go ahead, 
        fix your eyes at any one place in the thing and try to follow its path, tracing each
        twist and turn in one continuous motion. Use your finger or a pencil, if that makes it easier, but who are we kidding- it’s impossible, or at least very difficult and tedious, and probably requires more time than you or I have.

        But don’t feel bad! I mean, seriously, what else would you expect, you, 
        a 3-dimensional being, trying to trace an 11-dimensional shape rendered- which 
        is to say squashed down and flattened and corrupted- in the 2-dimensional space of a 
        computer or phone screen?
